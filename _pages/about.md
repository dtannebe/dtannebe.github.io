Mae govannen, mellon-nin! My name is Daniel Tanneberg, and I am a Senior Scientist at the [Honda Research Institute Europe](https://www.honda-ri.de).
My research lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics, with a focus on developing intelligent embodied agents that learn and adapt through interaction and experience.

Before joining Honda Research Institute Europe, I completed my `Ph.D. in Computer Science` at the [Technical University of Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/index.en.jsp) in 2020. I conducted my doctoral research at the [Intelligent Autonomous Systems Group](https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de), led by [Prof. Jan Peters](https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/Team/JanPeters), and was co-supervised by [Elmar Rueckert](https://cps.unileoben.ac.at/prof-elmar-rueckert/). 
My academic background also includes a `Master of Science in Computer Science` (with honors) in 2015, with a specialization in machine learning and robotics and a minor in biological psychology, as well as a `Bachelor of Science in Computer Science` in 2013 — both from the Technical University of Darmstadt.

Outside of research and science 🤖, I enjoy music 🎸, books 📚, (board) games 🎲🎮, and especially mountaineering 🏔️🧗.

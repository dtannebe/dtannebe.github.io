Mae govannen, mellon-nin! My name is Daniel Tanneberg and I am a Senior Scientist at the [Honda Research Institute Europe](https://www.honda-ri.de).
My research focuses on the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics, creating intelligent embodied agents that learn and adapt from interactions and experience.

Before joining Honda Research Institute Europe, I received my `Ph.D. in Computer Science` in 2020 from the [Technical University of Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/index.en.jsp), working at the [Intelligent Autonomous Systems Group](https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de) led by [Prof. Jan Peters](https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/Team/JanPeters), and was co-supervised by [Elmar Rueckert](https://cps.unileoben.ac.at/prof-elmar-rueckert/). 
I've received both, my `Master of Science in Computer Science` (with honors) in 2015 -- which focused on machine learning and robotics, and a minor in biological psychology -- and my `Bachelor of Science in Computer Science` in 2013 from the Technical University of Darmstadt.

Besides research and science 🤖, I enjoy music 🎸, books 📚, (board) games 🎲🎮, and especially mountaineering 🏔️🧗.
